                Serendipity, a discreetly named application, offers free online therapy, 24/7 licensed therapist and physician chats, a community to join, and goals for the user to customize and choose as they track their transition or journey to better mental health.

                In 2021 there are over <cite><a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2021/01/trends-mental-health-apps#:~:text=Mental%20health%2Drelated%20self%2Dhelp,unbiased%20information%20about%20such%20apps.">10,000 mental health applications</a></cite> for users to improve themselves over their phones. However, gender minority groups face more mental health issues than ever as their identity is difficult to explore and gender transitioning can be impossible for some and lead to more mental health issues as found in <cite>The Trevor Project's Annual Mental Health Report</cite>.

                This design won second place for Overall Best Design at the annual Women in Informatics Hackathon in 2021. Below is the demo.

                      Transition can be a scary and isolating feeling for many transgender youth and through Serendipity users will find community and support as they move towards better mental health.
