                Through this exercise, I utilized SQL, NoSQL, and data analysis skills to guide a student through the UW Registration system and how it works. With this Database a student will be able to register for classes, whether they be online or not, and access information about their courses, buildings, and professors                
            </p>
            <p>
                Below is the ERD that represents the database we coded through Azure Data Studio.

            <h3>
                Relationships and Possible Queries
            </h3>
            <p>
                Given that registration can depend on many different factors we limited the number of IDs we had. We wanted to be able to answer multiple questions a student might have.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example: What is the oldest building that had an Informatics class in it last year (2019)?
                This would be answered by querying:
            </p>
            <p>Create View OldestBuildingwithInfo as </p><p>(</p>
            <p>    Select top 1 B.BuildingName, B.YearBuilt
            </p>
            <p> from Building as B </p>
            <p>JOIN Room as R on r.BuildingID = b.buildingID</p>
            <p>JOIN Class as C on c.RoomID = R.RoomID</p>
            <p>JOIN Courses as X ON c.CourseID = x.CourseID</p> 
            <p>    JOIN Quarter as Q on c.QuarterID = q.quarterID
            </p>
            <p>    where x.DeptID = 'INFO'
            </p>
            <p>
                and Q.QuarterYear = 2019

            </p>
            <p>
                order by B.YearBuilt asc

            </p>
